# 🧠 Suad's Data Science Portfolio

Hi! I'm Suad — a curious Computer Science student trying to make sense of the world through data.  
This repository is where I share my journey into **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and other cool data things.

## 📂 What You'll Find Here

This repo contains mini-projects, experiments, and notebooks as I explore:

- 🧮 **Machine Learning**  
  Regression, Classification, Clustering, Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVMs, and more.

- 🧠 **Deep Learning**  
  Neural Networks, CNNs, Transfer Learning, and PyTorch/Keras experiments.

- 📊 **Data Exploration & Visualization**  
  Cleaning messy data, plotting, and discovering insights.

- 🛠️ **Other Cool Stuff**  
  Anything I found interesting or fun — from kaggle notebooks to random hacks.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

I'm constantly learning and improving — not everything here will be perfect, but that’s the point.  
I’d love feedback, suggestions, or just a thumbs-up if you find something cool.
